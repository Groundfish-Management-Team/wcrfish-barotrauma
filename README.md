# wcrfish-barotrauma

This analysis incorporates new data to estimate depth-specific barotrauma mortality rates for West Coast rockfish species. The initial analysis was conducted in 2014 by the Groundfish Management Team to the Pacific Fishery Management Council to estimate depth-specific barotrauma mortality rates for canary rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, and cowcod. This analysis follows the methodology used in 2014 where a hierarchical meta-analysis is applied to estimate barotrauma mortality within each pre-determined depth bin. The final analysis is publicly available [online](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2022/10/h-4-a-supplemental-gmt-report-1-development-of-generalized-discard-mortality-rates-reflecting-the-use-of-descending-devices-for-rockfishes-of-the-genus-sebastes.pdf/). The discard mortality rates with the use of descending devices [recommended for use by management by the Groundfish Mortality Team](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2022/11/h-4-a-supplemental-gmt-report-3.pdf/) were adopted by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at the November 2022 meeting.
